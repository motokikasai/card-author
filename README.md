# Author bio card

Let's create an author card that can appear under a blog post for example.

Must have:
* [] the author image is a circle
* [] the author image is aligned to the top of the card content
* [] the follow button is aligned with the author name

Extra:
* [] written by label is in lighter gray and all caps
* [] author name is noticeably bigger
* [] card has space on top an bottom
* [] the card has a separating line on top

Take a look at the example image:

Extra extra:

* [] add the card in the context of a simple article page
* [] use proper class names
